The flappy bird project was a single player game made in pygame, the bird had a few animation the bars would appear randomly - for a certain scope, the game was later
supposed to be turned into a multiplayer type game - with two other birds on the screen at the same time from different computer that each whould have their own line
to move and last to hit an object would win the game - I didnt fully programmed it at the end 

the project took about a week
